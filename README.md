## 📍 Overview

Vehicle recognition and tracking applications are essential tools for both civilian and military purposes, aiding in highway traffic surveillance control, management, and urban traffic planning. These applications are critical for monitoring vehicle movement, counting vehicles, determining average speeds, analyzing traffic flow, and categorizing vehicles. Such systems must be adaptable to various environmental conditions to ensure accurate performance.

## 📦 Features

**1. Real-time Vehicle Recognition:**

Utilizes advanced image processing techniques to identify and track moving vehicles in real-time.
Accurate detection of vehicles regardless of environmental conditions such as lighting and weather.

**2. Traffic Flow Monitoring:**

Analyzes video sequences from traffic cameras to monitor traffic flow.
Provides data on vehicle counts, average speeds, and traffic density.

**3. Vehicle Tracking:**

Implements blob tracking technologies to follow the movement of vehicles across video frames.
Maintains accurate tracking even in high-density traffic scenarios.

**4. Adaptive Background Subtraction:**

Uses adaptive subtracted background technology to differentiate between moving vehicles and static background.
Ensures robust vehicle detection by adapting to changes in the environment.

**5. Virtual Detectors:**

Deploys virtual detectors within the video feed to mark specific areas for detailed traffic analysis.
Enables focused monitoring of critical points such as intersections and highway exits.

**6. Vehicle Categorization:**

Classifies vehicles into different categories (e.g., cars, trucks, motorcycles) based on their size and shape.
Supports traffic analysis and planning by providing detailed vehicle type data.

**7. Traffic Analysis Tools:**

Offers comprehensive tools for analyzing traffic patterns and generating reports.
Assists in urban traffic planning and decision-making processes by providing actionable insights.

**8. Integration with Existing Systems:**

Can be integrated with existing traffic management systems for enhanced functionality.
Compatible with various camera setups and infrastructure configurations.

**9. OpenCV and Java Implementation:**

Developed using Java and OpenCV, ensuring a robust and efficient processing pipeline.
Leverages OpenCV’s powerful image processing capabilities for accurate vehicle detection and tracking.

**10. Experimental Validation:**

Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of the proposed method.
Validated under different traffic conditions to ensure wide applicability.
